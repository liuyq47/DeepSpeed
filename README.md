[DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) is a deep learning optimization
library that makes distributed training easy, efficient, and effective.

<p align="center"><i><b>10x Larger Models</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>10x Faster Training</b></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><b>Minimal Code Change</b></i></p>

DeepSpeed can train deep learning models with over a hundred billion parameters on current
generation of GPU clusters, while achieving over 10x in system performance
compared to the state-of-art. Early adopters of DeepSpeed have already produced
a language model (LM) with over 17B parameters called
[Turing-NLG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft),
establishing a new SOTA in the LM category.

DeepSpeed is an important part of Microsoftâ€™s new
[AI at Scale](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-at-scale/)
initiative to enable next-generation AI capabilities at scale, where you can find more
information [here](https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/exploring-ai-at-scale).

# Why DeepSpeed?
Training advanced deep learning models is challenging. Beyond model design,
model scientists also need to set up the state-of-the-art training techniques
such as distributed training, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, and
checkpointing. Yet still, scientists may not achieve the desired system
performance and convergence rate. Large model sizes are even more challenging:
a large model easily runs out of memory with pure data parallelism and it is
difficult to use model parallelism. DeepSpeed addresses these challenges to
accelerate model development *and* training.
